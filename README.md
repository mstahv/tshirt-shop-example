# Simple Spring Boot + Vaadin example

The example contains a view that submits T-shirt orders. Bit similar to what you probably implemented recently at our expo booth. 
You can use it as a basis for your Vaadin experiments. This version submits the orders to JPA backend, validated the data automatically based on JSR-303 annotations in the domain object and also contains a view to list current submissions.

To play around with the example, check it out using git or download the zip.
Import it to your favorite IDE and execute the Application class or start the app
from command line using: 

    mvn spring-boot:run

The application opens to http://localhost:8080
